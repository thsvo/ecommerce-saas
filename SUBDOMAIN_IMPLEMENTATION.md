# Subdomain Implementation Summary

## Changes Made for Complete Admin Subdomain Isolation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Products Table**: Added `createdBy` field to associate products with specific admins
- **Categories Table**: Added `createdBy` field and unique constraint allowing same category names for different admins
- **User Relations**: Added proper relations between User model and created content

### 2. Middleware Enhancements
- **middleware.ts**: Updated to properly handle subdomain routing without forcing admin routes
- **subdomainCheck.ts**: Enhanced to detect subdomain context and attach admin ID to requests

### 3. Context and Hooks Updates
- **SubdomainContext**: Enhanced to detect if current user is the subdomain admin
- **useCurrentSubdomain**: Added API endpoint filtering and subdomain detection capabilities

### 4. API Route Updates
All critical API routes now support admin isolation:
- **products/index.ts**: Filters products by admin ID for subdomain requests
- **products/[id].ts**: Ensures product access is restricted to creating admin
- **categories/index.ts**: Filters categories by admin ID for subdomain requests  
- **categories/[id].ts**: Ensures category access is restricted to creating admin

### 5. Frontend Page Updates
All frontend pages now respect subdomain context:
- **index.tsx**: Homepage shows only subdomain admin's products
- **products.tsx**: Product listing filtered by subdomain admin
- **categories.tsx**: Category listing filtered by subdomain admin

### 6. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Navbar**: Shows subdomain branding and provides admin panel access for subdomain owners
- **Admin Access**: Only subdomain owners can access their admin panel
- **Visual Indicators**: Subdomain name displayed in top bar

## Key Features Implemented

### Complete Isolation
- ✅ Each admin has completely separate product catalog
- ✅ Each admin has completely separate category management
- ✅ Products created by one admin are invisible to others
- ✅ Categories can have same names across different admins

### Frontend Experience
- ✅ Subdomain homepage shows only that admin's products
- ✅ All product pages filtered by subdomain context
- ✅ Category pages show only subdomain admin's content
- ✅ Search functionality works within subdomain scope

### Admin Panel Access
- ✅ Admin panel accessible via subdomain/admin
- ✅ Only subdomain owner can access their admin panel
- ✅ Admin panel shows subdomain-specific data
- ✅ Admin operations (create/edit/delete) scoped to subdomain

### Security & Access Control
- ✅ API requests automatically filtered by subdomain context
- ✅ Cross-admin content access prevented
- ✅ Subdomain validation on all administrative operations

## Testing Instructions

### Local Setup
1. Update hosts file:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 test.localhost
   127.0.0.1 admin1.localhost
   127.0.0.1 admin2.localhost
   ```

2. Create admin users with subdomains using the admin creation script

3. Test isolation by:
   - Creating products/categories as different admins
   - Visiting different subdomains to verify content isolation
   - Attempting cross-admin access (should be blocked)

### Production Deployment
- Configure wildcard DNS (*.yourdomain.com)
- Ensure SSL certificate supports wildcards
- Update environment variables for production domains

## Migration Applied
- Migration `20250701092241_add_admin_isolation_to_products_and_categories` successfully applied
- Database schema now supports complete admin isolation

## Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `middleware.ts`
- `contexts/SubdomainContext.tsx`
- `hooks/useCurrentSubdomain.ts`
- `components/Navbar.tsx`
- `pages/index.tsx`
- `pages/products.tsx`
- `pages/categories.tsx`
- `pages/api/products/index.ts`
- `pages/api/products/[id].ts`
- `pages/api/categories/index.ts`
- `pages/api/categories/[id].ts`
- `SUBDOMAIN_SETUP.md`

## Next Steps
The subdomain functionality is now fully implemented. Each admin can:
1. Access their own isolated admin panel via their subdomain
2. Create and manage products/categories that only appear on their subdomain
3. Have customers visit their subdomain to see only their products
4. Operate completely independently from other admins

The system provides complete multi-tenancy with subdomain-based isolation while maintaining a shared codebase and database.
